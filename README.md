# Starter Project - Introduction to Python and Pandas


## Project Overview

The repository consists of four individual assignments (opgave_1 through opgave_4) which were designed to get the student started with coding in Python and get acquainted with datamanagement libraries such as Pandas and matplotlib 

## Assignment overview and objectives

### opgave_1

The objective of this assignment was to sort a list of names (Navne_liste.txt) by different parameters using Python's built in functions, as well as to calculate and visualize frequencies and word length using wordcloud, matplolib or seaborn libraries

### opgave_2

Logfile analysis: Attempt to create a script which reads and filters certain log messages, such as "ERROR", within a log file. Save these in a new file. 

### opgave_3

Create a script that reads data from a source file (source_data.csv) and write it to a new file. Implement the functionality to handle the errors that might occur

### opgave_4

Assignment with the aim of getting acquainted with Pandas - Reading a csv file (DKHousingPricesSampleDK) as a DataFrame and apply the GroupBy function in various ways. Finally visualize the data within the DataFrame using one or more of the data visualization libraries

## Data

All the data used for the assignments can be found in the data directory
